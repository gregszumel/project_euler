/*
A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of the 
unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given:
 
1 / 2	=0.5	
1 / 3	=0.(3)	
1 / 4	=0.25	
1 / 5	=0.2	
1 / 6	=0.1(6)	
1 / 7	=0.(142857)	
1 / 8	=0.125	
1 / 9	=0.(1)	
1 / 10	=0.1 

Where 0.1 ( 6) means 0.166666 â‹¯ , and has a 1 -digit recurring cycle. It can be 
seen that 1 / 7 has a 6 -digit recurring cycle.  

Find the value of d < 1000 for which 1 / d contains the longest recurring cycle 
in its decimal fraction part.
